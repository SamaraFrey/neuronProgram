/*
This is the main class for neurons, afterwards we will have subclasses which inherit from it.
 -> inhibitory and excitatory
Each neuron has certain amount of connections, some spike it gives and receives and its  own local clock.

We store how many spikes it does and when they occur. The membrane potentials of the neuron are going to be printed into a seperate file -> this happens in main.
