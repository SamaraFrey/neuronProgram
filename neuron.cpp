/**
* This is the main class for neurons, afterwards we will have subclasses which inherit from it.

* Each neuron has certain amount of connections, some spike it gives and receives and its  own local clock.
*
* We store how many spikes it does and when they occur. The membrane potentials of the neuron are going to be printed into a seperate file -> this happens in main.
